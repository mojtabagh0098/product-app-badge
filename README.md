# Product Badge App

Product Badge App is a Shopify app template that helps you add custom badges to products in your store. Built with Remix, it provides out-of-the-box authentication, API integration, and a modern UI using Polaris, making it easy to develop and deploy Shopify apps quickly.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

1. **Node.js**: [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) it if you haven't already.
2. **Shopify Partner Account**: [Create an account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you don't have one.
3. **Test Store**: Set up either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store) for testing your app.

### Setup

If you used the CLI to create the template, you can skip this section.

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn install
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Local Development

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Press P to open the URL to your app. Once you click install, you can start development.

Local development is powered by [the Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli). It logs into your partners account, connects to an app, provides environment variables, updates remote config, creates a tunnel and provides commands to generate extensions.


### Build

Remix handles building the app for you, by running the command below with the package manager of your choice:

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn build
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run build
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run build
```

## Hosting

When you're ready to set up your app in production, you can follow [our deployment documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web) to host your app on a cloud provider like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

When you reach the step for [setting up environment variables](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web#set-env-vars), you also need to set the variable `NODE_ENV=production`.

### Hosting on Vercel

Using the Vercel Preset is recommended when hosting your Shopify Remix app on Vercel. You'll also want to ensure imports that would normally come from `@remix-run/node` are imported from `@vercel/remix` instead. Learn more about hosting Remix apps on Vercel [here](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/remix).

```diff
// vite.config.ts
import { vitePlugin as remix } from "@remix-run/dev";
import { defineConfig, type UserConfig } from "vite";
import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";
+ import { vercelPreset } from '@vercel/remix/vite';

installGlobals();

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    remix({
      ignoredRouteFiles: ["**/.*"],
+     presets: [vercelPreset()],
    }),
    tsconfigPaths(),
  ],
});
```
